ext
=========

This directory holds git submodules that point to libraries needed by the j2k plug-ins.

You will need to manually add the After Effects CS5 SDK, available from [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/aftereffects.html).

At the moment, you will also need to copy Kakadu 6.3.1 here.

If the submodule contents are missing, you should be able to get them by typing:

`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`
